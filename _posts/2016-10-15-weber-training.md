Responsive website for Christoph Weber, a personal trainer in Germany.

Since the client wanted to be able to change the contents (text, images, etc.) by himself, I set up a Content Management System using [Kirby](https://getkirby.com), which is written in PHP.

For the front-end design I used the [Bootstrap](http://responsive-nav.com/) framework and created a genuine theme.

I also created the logotype.
