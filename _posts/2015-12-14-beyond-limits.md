Responsive one pager website for Christin Just and her personal training offer "Beyond Limits".

Since the client wished to be able to change the contents (text, images, etc.) by herself, I set up a Content Management System using [Kirby](https://getkirby.com), which is written in PHP.

For the front-end design I used the [Bootstrap](http://responsive-nav.com/) framework.
