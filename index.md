I'm a software engineer with more than 10 years of experience buidling web and mobile products.

Currently, I'm shaping the future of public transportation at [Ioki](https://ioki.com), a company of Deutsche Bahn, in Frankfurt.

From time to time, I work as a freelance consultant for small clients, helping them go online and expand their businesses digitally.
